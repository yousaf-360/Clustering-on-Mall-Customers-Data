# K Means Clustering Project

In this project, I conducted K Means clustering on my dataset to effectively segregate customers. Here is an overview of the key steps in the process:

## Dataset Exploration

- Investigated the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its details.

## Data Preprocessing

- Applied label encoding to age and gender for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Plotted relationships between each column to visualize patterns and insights within the data.

## K Means Clustering

- Utilized the K Means clustering algorithm with different values.
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

## Results

- Identified the best value for clustering.
- Applied the chosen clustering approach to segregate customers effectively.

## Business Insights

- Leveraged clustering results to develop policies and strategies based on customer segmentation.

This project demonstrates the application of K Means clustering as a powerful tool for customer segmentation, providing valuable insights for policy development and decision-making.
